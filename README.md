# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description 

For the work day scheduler assignment, our task was to build ontop of the provided code and implement third party apis such as jQuery, Bootstrap and Moment.js. We also had to make sure when a user inputs information it saves on local storage as well as adding a save icon, and additional styles such as colors and fonts.  

I started off by examining the starter code and viewing the html in the live server. I then used Moment.js to display the current day at the top of the page. Next I created 10 rows in the html file and used Bootstrap to style these rows according to the displayed mockup. I found it helpful that the css styles already had most of the styles set up as well. 


I found a save icon on google apis and added the link to the html file as well as the icon to each of the section classes. 
Next I created a function in javascript so the user could write a task in the time slots. In addition I added script to connect the local storage so when a user inputs data it would save locally. 

This task was challenging but also a good practice of third party apis.
